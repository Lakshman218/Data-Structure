Node: A fundamental part of a tree that holds data and may have a link to other nodes (children).
Root: The topmost node in a tree, serving as the starting point for traversing the tree.
Parent: A node in a tree that has one or more child nodes.
Child: A node in a tree that has a parent node.Leaf: A node in a tree that has no children, i.e., it is at the end of a branch.
Siblings: Nodes that share the same parent in a tree.
Depth: The level or distance of a node from the root. The root is at depth 0, its children are at depth 1, and so on.
Height: The length of the longest path from a node to a leaf. The height of the tree is the height of the root node.
